I started developing my first real projects in 2019 when I enrolled in a diploma program in Computer Engineering. My journey into tech started way earlier though—tinkering with basic C programs and creating static web pages using **HTML** and **CSS** in school. As I explored further, I was drawn to how apps work, how people collaborate online, and how code turns into real solutions.

What really sparked things for me was discovering **Flutter**. The idea of building beautiful apps for Android and iOS from a single codebase blew my mind. From there, I dove deep into **Dart**, **Firebase**, and mobile development frameworks. I started creating mini-projects and contributing to community events.

By the time I was in my second year of engineering, I had already published multiple apps, led workshops, and joined Google Developer Student Clubs as a **Flutter Lead**. I loved mentoring people, helping juniors grasp layouts, state management, and best practices in app architecture.

## My Beginnings in Programming 🖥️

In college, I took part in coding competitions and hackathons while also building full-stack projects with **PHP**, **MySQL**, and later, **Supabase**. I experimented with web hosting, APIs, auth systems, and gradually developed an interest in real-time systems.

That led to my most exciting personal project—**Synapse**, a collaborative learning platform built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, **Supabase**, and **LiveKit**. It’s a place for students to create rooms, chat, join video calls, and share resources. I built it to reflect what I wished I had when studying in groups.

## My Professional Experience 💼

In late 2023, I interned at **ERK Labs**, where I worked on CRM optimization, performance profiling, and reusable UI packages. By January 2024, I was hired full-time and led the development of a social-media-style hiring app with live features and a gRPC-powered backend.

In September 2024, I moved to **MSA Software**, working on enterprise-level Flutter applications and building mobile-first solutions for internal operations. From architecture to code reviews, I’ve had a chance to lead and grow with every sprint.

## The Power of Community 🌍

Outside of work, I love sharing. I’ve conducted multiple Flutter sessions, guided juniors on how to build and deploy apps, and even helped launch final-year projects for college students. I actively post on LinkedIn, maintain projects on GitHub, and keep building in public.

I believe learning never stops. I keep experimenting with **Supabase Edge Functions**, **TailwindCSS**, and even dipping my toes into **AI integrations** to explore what’s next.

## A Bit More About Me ☕

In 2025, I’m focused on scaling Synapse further, giving more talks, and launching micro-tools that help students, developers, and self-learners. I love strong coffee ☕, clear UIs 🎨, and open-source thinking 🧠. You’ll often find me planning side-projects, mentoring a friend, or watching conference replays on 2x speed.

I’m **Anuj Barve**, and I thank you for being a part of this journey.

## Let’s build something awesome! 🚀
